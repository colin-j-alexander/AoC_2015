```{r setup}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(warning = FALSE, message = FALSE)
library(tidyverse)
```


This is the input I was given:
```{r echo=FALSE}
input <- read.table("Day1_Input1.csv")
input <- input$V1
print(input)
```

A quick and dirty solution would be to count the nos of '(' and ')' and then take the difference to determine the floor.

```{r }
up   <- str_count(input, "\\(")
down <- str_count(input, "\\)")
floor <- up - down 
```

Santa goes up `r up` floors and down `r down` floors taking him to floor `r floor`.
